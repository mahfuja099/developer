      <h1>DREAM PLACE</h1>
      <h2>DUBI........</h2>
      <p class="ww">
        Dubí is located about 5 kilometres (3 mi) northwest of Teplice and 16 km (10 mi) west of Ústí nad Labem. The
        municipal
        territory, specifically the village of Cínovec, is located on the Czech-German border. The southern part of the
        territory with most of the built-up area lies in the Most Basin, the northern part lies in the Ore Mountains.
        The
        highest point is the hill Cínovecký hřbet at 881 metres (2,890 ft). The Bystřice Stream flows through the town.

        History
        The first written mentions of Dubí are from the period 1494–1498, when it was a mining settlement of tin miners.
        Later
        the town became famous for the production of glass and porcelain, and for spas.[2]

        Spa
        The first spas in Dubí were built in 1860 under the management of Anton Tschinkel, the founder of a local
        porcelain
        factory. In 1862, his first spa (Diana's Spa) was opened. The present-day Theresa's Spa with mineral waters,
        recommended
        to patients after brain and spine surgeries, have been operating since 1879.[3]
